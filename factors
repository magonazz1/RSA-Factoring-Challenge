"""Factor numbers in a file.

This script reads a file containing natural numbers and factors each number
into a product of two smaller numbers. It then prints the factorizations in
the format "n=p*q" for each number.

Usage: factors <file>
where <file> is a file containing natural numbers to factor, one per line.

You can assume that all lines will be valid natural numbers greater than 1,
and there will be no empty lines, and no space before and after the valid number.

The file will always end with a new line.

Your program should run without any dependency, and it will be killed after 5
seconds if it hasnâ€™t finished.

Push all your scripts, source code, etc. to your repository.

only run your executable 'factors'.
